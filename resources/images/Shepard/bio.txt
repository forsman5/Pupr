Australian Cattle Dog
null
Shepard loves to chew on things. He could not get enough of the chew toy as he did everything in his power to pursue it, no matter what we did with it. When he couldn't get the chew toy, he went for my shoelaces and pants legs instead. When you picked him up though he was very calm. Something particularly awesome about this dog is the color of his coat, which is similar to that of some Australian Shepherds.

Shiba Inu
null
Out of all of the shibes we have played with, Squirt is the most reserved. Usually the shibas are
bouncing around and biting at pants and shoelaces, but Squirt showed a bit more restrain (and love for shoes).
When picked up, it looks like Squirt tries to fly throw the sky! Although it looks really cute, we figured that
Squirt was uncomfortable when picked up like this so we didn't do it often. 
Overall, this was one of our favorite shibes. We even came back to play with Squirt a second time. Just look
at how cute that face is!

Beagle
null
Now this was a dog's dog. Adventurous (thus Scout) and excited to see more of the world,
his desire to explore his surroundings was matched only by his love of gnawing on
his red bone, one of his favorite pastimes. Scout enjoyed playing with us, including
a primitive version of fetch, but seemed pretty uninterested in being tossed around like
a plaything. Overall, one of the most excellent dogs!

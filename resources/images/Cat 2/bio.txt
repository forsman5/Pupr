Siamese Cat
null
Ah. The OG. The first kitten we ever played with in a petland.
Now “played with” might be the wrong word to use, as this little cutie was only interested in cuddling. But look at that face and tell me you wouldn’t cuddle with her forever. I know you can’t. This kitten loved being pet and curling up in your lap. Amazing.

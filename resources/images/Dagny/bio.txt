Samoyed dog
null
The name for this pup is inspired by a Samoyed named Atlas that is popular on social media. The name Atlas made us thought of the novel Atlas Shrugged, where Dagny Taggart is the main character. Dagny is an absolutely incredible dog and she loved getting pets. When you picked her up it felt like holding a cloud since she is 90% fluff. She was tired when we got to play with her so she was not very energetic.

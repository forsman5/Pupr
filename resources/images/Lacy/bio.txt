American Hairless Terrier

Oh my god. What. A. Cat. 
Seriously, best kitten I’ve ever played with at petland. Super playful but happy to cuddle, too. By the time we figured out she didn’t want to play with any of the little balls we had for her, and was only interested in our shoelaces, we were all rushing to take our shoes off so she could chase them around the pen. We played with her for a solid 10 minutes and she loved every second of it. This kitten will certainly grow up to be an incredible cat.

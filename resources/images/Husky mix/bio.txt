Alaskan husky
Basenji
We only got to play with this guy for a little bit, but what a beautiful dog!
While we did get to play with him, he was very jumpy, and loved to jump up and say hello!
We think he's a mix of a Husky and a Basenji, but we're not totally sure.
Let us know if you have a better idea than we do!

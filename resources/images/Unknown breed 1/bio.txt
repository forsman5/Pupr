West Highland White Terrier
null
This poor dog was very unsure of itself. It seemed very scared of the world as a whole.
He wanted to play with us a little bit, but was very reserved, and actually seemed more
comfortable when being puppeted around by Sabrina than he seemed when exploring the world.
Overall, a decently pitiful animal, but for some people, that's their thing I guess.

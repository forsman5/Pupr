Husky
null
This pup was quite the escape artist. He was certainly more interested in trying to
escape from the room than he was in playing. With his large size and daring nature, he actually came pretty
close since he could jump up onto the bench with relative ease. Another thing to note about this dog is that it
did not like being picked up. Getting any photos of him was certainly a challenge. Despite how difficult he was,
this dog was adorable and we loved playing with him.

Golden Retriever

Now THIS is a good boy. Everything about this dog was absolutely incredible, from his adorable face to his
playful nature. Alfred's favorite toy was the green ball. He LOVED playing fetch. Sadly, the playroom was
quite small so fetch was not very well optimized. Regardless, we still had a good time.
Sometimes, Alfred wanted to keep the ball for himself. He would pick it up, slump down on the ground 
and chew on it, which was quite adorable. Eventually he insisted on biting the wall in the corner, and he
refused to stop. We did not have time to take him on a leash that day so we had to say goodbye early.

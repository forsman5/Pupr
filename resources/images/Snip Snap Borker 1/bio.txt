American Eskimo Dog
null
This dog has proven to be an enigma to us. We really aren't sure what breed he is, but research has led us
to believe that he is an American Eskimo Dog. Out of all of the dogs we have played with, this one has easily
been the most energetic. This dog was an absolute nut. Constantly bouncing off the walls and jumping
up and down, he relentlessly pursued the plush toy that was in the playroom. We were worried that he would
tear it apart. His constant hyperactivity was not a bad thing though, since he was very playful.
Picking him up proved to be a dangerous activity, since his excitement levels were off the charts.
Be careful when handling this dog!

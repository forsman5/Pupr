Maltese dog
null
This is one of the more timid dogs that we have encountered at petland, and we felt kind of bad about it.
We could tell pretty quickly that it was not comfortable with the whole situation. Based on this pup's personality, we decided to name it Courage
as a reference to Courage the Cowardly Dog, which was an old cartoon. We tried to make Courage feel
a bit better by using the toys, but to no avail. When presented with the plastic
set of keys, Courage franically batted them away and backed into the corner. Sadly, we didn't get to spend
much time with this dog. We hope that Courage gains a bit of confidence in the future!

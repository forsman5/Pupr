American Cocker Spaniel

Look into those eyes. Just do it. Come on, you already know this pup is incredible. Seriously, 10 out of 10. Very calm and cuddly when being held, and very energetic when you put him down. This did make it difficult to get a good picture of him, however. That combined with his puppy teeth (which are still very sharp, I can assure you) made him a feisty playmate.

Husky
null
Sarge was a little shy, but overall an excellent dog! Or he might have just been lazy!
He loved to plop down like he does in the one of pictures and sit with his legs out behind him,
and then kind of avoid our gazes, like he was shy! When he could get over being shy,
and before he got tired, he really loved to play with the little balls, jumping and pouncing
on them really dramatically!

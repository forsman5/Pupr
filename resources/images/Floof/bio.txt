Husky
Pomeranian dog
Words can't describe the incredible feeling you get when you pick this dog up.
I simply could not let it out of my arms because it was the softest thing I have ever held.
It felt like a brand new blanket. On top of that, it was super playful. Floof loved playing with all of the
toys in the room, and he was very calm when being picked up. He did make a mess on the floor at some point,
but he is so cute that it was easy to forgive him.

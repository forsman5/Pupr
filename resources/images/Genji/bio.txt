Shiba Inu
null
Shiba Inu's are one of Zach's favorite dog breeds, and petland always has at least one or two at any time.
So at every visit, we get one to play with. Genji was the first Shiba we played with in our petland history,
and it was Zach's first visit to Petland. You can tell by how happy we looks in this photo that he loved this 
dog. It is quite an interesting story how we got the name for this dog. Before going to Petland that day,
we stopped (at Sabrina's request) at this quickservice Japanese restaurant that was quite disgusting. The
restaurant was called Genji Go, and that led to this pup being named Genji.
He was quite the ball of energy. Upon being unleashed in the pet room, he relentlessly attacked our shoe laces.
Eventually, we figured that this room was too small for him, so we took him on a leash so he could have more
freedom to roam. Despite initially attacking the leash for a few minutes, the walk seemed to call him down.

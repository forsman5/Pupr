Mr. Clean was something special, that's for sure. The first think you are probably asking yourself is why he
is named Mr. Clean. Well when we had him in the room he had a bit of an accident on the floor, and while we 
were trying to clean it up Mr. Clean tried to clean it up himself. As a result, Mr. Clean has become sort
of a running joke. Regardless, he was a big goofball and we love him.

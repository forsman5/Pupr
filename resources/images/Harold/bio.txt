Newfoundland

Harold was an incredible dog. Already of slightly intimidating stature, it was clear
one day Harold would be larger than Sabrina. However, he was very gentle with his size,
never being aggressive to any smaller dogs or throwing his weight around.
Harold was a joy to take around on a leash. He really enjoyed biting the floor or corners of
the containers of merchandise in the store.
